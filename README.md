AlgerianFireModel
🔥 Algerian Fire Model – FWI Prediction System

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using meteorological and environmental parameters from the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset.

The model is trained using historical fire weather data and deployed using Flask, allowing users to input parameters via a web interface and get real-time predictions.

📌 Problem Statement

Forest fires are highly influenced by weather and environmental conditions. Predicting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) helps assess fire risk levels and enables better prevention and response strategies.

This project aims to:

Train an ML model on Algerian forest fire data

Predict FWI based on user inputs

Deploy the model using a simple Flask web application
